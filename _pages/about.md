I am a PhD student at MIT in the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~cua/www/quanta/" target="_blank">Quanta Lab</a> at the Center of Ultracold Atoms, advised by <a href="http://feynman.mit.edu/ike/homepage/index.html" target="_blank">Isaac Chuang</a>. My research interests lie in quantum computing, machine learning, graphical models and broadly in algorithms for inference.

In the past, I was an undergraduate at IIT Bombay, and I have interned at IBM, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Space Science Engineering Center.
