I am a PhD student at MIT in the [Quanta Lab](http://web.mit.edu/~cua/www/quanta/) at the Center of Ultracold Atoms, advised by [Isaac Chuang](http://feynman.mit.edu/ike/homepage/index.html). My research interests lie in quantum computing, machine learning, graphical models and broadly in algorithms for inference.

In the past, I was an undergraduate at IIT Bombay, and I have interned at IBM, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Space Science Engineering Center.
